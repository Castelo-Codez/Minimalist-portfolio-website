## Brief

Your challenge is to build out this **multi-page portfolio** website and get it looking as close to the design as possible. The download includes mobile, tablet & desktop designs for a Homepage, Portfolio index page, Portfolio detail pages, and a Contact page. A design system is also included to provide colors, fonts, etc.

> You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

-   Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
    -   The **Name**, **EmailAddress** are empty should show "This field is required"
    -   **EmailAddress** is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
